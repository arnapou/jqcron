jqCron
======

Cron jQuery plugin

Originaly created in july 2012.

Important ⚠️
--------------------

> 1️⃣ The project is hosted on **[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/arnapou/jqcron)** (github is only a synchronized repo).<br>
> 2️⃣ **I have not the time to maintain** anything here outside the small php class.<br>
> 3️⃣ **Make a PR** if you want to have a chance to see changes.<br>
> 4️⃣ This is a **very old** project, nowadays, it could be ported to be browser-native without any jQuery.

If you are a JS developer and want to maintain this repo, feel free to contact me.
